# Test challenge for frontend developers

### Part 1

Using any language and any framework implement your nice solution following the requirements:

- Request API to get list of products. For this challenge please mock a server and use the fake data (`data` folder)
- Display the list using paging with possibility to change items count, e.q. 4, 6 (see `products_view.jpg`)
- As a bonus add a feature to switch the representation between 2 modes (gallery/list)
- On an item click request a product and display details on the right panel (see `product_view.jpg`)
  - Add a panel with tabs: `Textiles` `Rules` `Suppliers` (data for last 2 omitted for simplicity, leave content blank)
  - Add a slider to show product images
  - Add buttons to save and share the product

Note: it's not required to follow provided views, feel free to show creativity.

### Part 2

We value “thinking out of the box” and ability to research new ideas and solutions for challenging new developments.

The question is: “How would you build this 3D Universe?” (See attached pictures).

This exercise is a free task that can be either coded or explained in written form.

The points represent textiles. When you click on particular textile (point) it shows similar textiles (other points) from the database.
You can select either all points or isolate particular ones. You can also adjust amount of neighboring textiles you would like to find.
